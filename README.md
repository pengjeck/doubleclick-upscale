2. In your browser, open the Extensions page (usually found under More Tools in the browser menu).
3. Enable Developer Mode, drag and drop the downloaded file into the browser window, and confirm the installation.

## Usage

- Right-click on the area you want to magnify and click "zoomIn" to enlarge; 
- press key `Esc` to exit magnification.
